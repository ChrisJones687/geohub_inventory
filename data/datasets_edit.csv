https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526333
This dataset consists of six years of weighing lysimeter data for six seasons of maize grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) for 1989, 1990, 1994, 2013, 2016, and 2018. Maize was grown on four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure mass, which was converted to relative soil water storage with 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Although a quality control process was used, the ET data in this dataset are considered raw data. Advanced algorithms for detection of precipitation, dew and frost were applied in a separate process to determine ET values that are reported in files in a dataset entitled ""Evapotranspiration and Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets"". Those files have ""water-balance"" in their names. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity, components of the radiation balance (e.g., net radiation, incoming and reflected shortwave, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), incoming and reflected longwave, thermal infrared emitted by the plant/soil surface), soil heat flux, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at certain depths. Not all properties were always sensed in any one year; and instruments used changed from season to season, which are reasons that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required.
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on maize ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), by OPENET, and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.",opensource,excel,Excel,server,Data are on the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons,public,ARS,Evett_Steven,100gb,continuous,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,NA,"Weighing Lysimeter Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets","Weighing Lysimeter Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets",Soil Water

https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/bushland-texas-winter-wheat-datasets
This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for each growing season (two-year period) when winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Winter wheat was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, calibrated to NIST standards (Howell et al., 1995). Each lysimeter was in the center of a 4.44 ha square field on which wheat was also grown (Evett et al., 2000). The two fields were contiguous and arranged with one directly north of the other. See the resource titled ""Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas"" for UTM geographic coordinates for field and lysimeter locations. Wheat was planted in Autumn and grown over the winter in 1989-1990, 1991-1992, and 1992-1993. Agronomic calendar for the each of the three growing seasons list by date the agronomic practices applied, severe weather, and activities (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest) in and on lysimeters that could influence crop growth, water use, and lysimeter data. These include fertilizer and pesticide applications. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system equipped with pressure regulated low pressure sprays (mid-elevation spray application, MESA). Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a field-calibrated (Evett and Steiner, 1995) neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field. The lysimeters and fields were planted to the same plant density, row spacing, tillage depth (by hand on the lysimeters and by machine in the fields), and fertilizer and pesticide applications. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation, dew and frost accumulation, and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and humidity, radiant energy (incoming and reflected, typically both shortwave and longwave), surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil temperature, all of which are reported at 15-minute intervals. Instruments used changed from season to season, which is another reason that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required. The Bushland weighing lysimeter research program was described by Evett et al. (2016), and lysimeter design is described by Marek et al. (1988).

This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for each growing season (year) when alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) was grown as a reference evapotranspiration (ETr) crop at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Alfalfa was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, calibrated to NIST standards (Howell et al., 1995). Each lysimeter was in the center of a 4.44 ha square field on which alfalfa was also grown (Evett et al., 2000). The two fields were contiguous and arranged with one (labeled northeast, NE) directly north of the other (labeled southeast, SE). See the resource titled ""Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas"" for UTM geographic coordinates for field and lysimeter locations. Alfalfa was planted in Autumn 1995 and grown for hay in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. The resource titled, ""Agronomic Calendar for the Bushland, Texas Alfalfa Datasets"", gives a calendar listing by date the agronomic practices applied, severe weather, and activities (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest) in and on lysimeters that could influence crop growth, water use, and lysimeter data. These include fertilizer and pesticide applications. There is one calendar, beginning before planting in autumn 1995 and ending after final harvest is 1999, for the NE and SE lysimeters and fields. There were four harvests in each year except for 1998 when five harvests were taken. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system equipped with pressure regulated low pressure sprays (mid-elevation spray application, MESA). Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a field-calibrated (Evett and Steiner, 1995) neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field.

This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for each growing season (year) when maize (Zea mays, L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Maize was grown for grain on between two and four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four fields were contiguous and arranged in four quadrants, which were labeled northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). See the resource titled ""Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas"" for UTM geographic coordinates for field and lysimeter locations. Maize was grown on only the NE and SE fields in 1989 and 1990, and on all four fields in 1994, 2013, 2016, and 2018. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1989, 1990, and 1994, although the system was equipped with various application technologies such as high-pressure impact sprinklers, low pressure spray applications, and low energy precision applicators (LEPA). In 2013, 2016, and 2018, two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system equipped with spray applicators. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field. The number and spacing of neutron probe reading locations changed through the years (additional sites were added), which is one reason why subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries are needed. The lysimeters and fields were planted to the same plant density, row spacing, tillage depth (by hand on the lysimeters and by machine in the fields), and fertilizer and pesticide applications. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation, dew and frost accumulation, and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals.

This dataset consists of weather data for each year when maize was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Maize was grown for grain on four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with the fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1989, 1990, and 1994. In 2013, 2016, and 2018, two lysimeters and their respective fields (NE and SE) were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields (NW and SW) were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field.
The weather data include solar irradiance, barometric pressure, air temperature and relative humidity, and wind speed determined using sensors placed at 2-m height over a level, grass surface mowed to not exceed 12 cm height and irrigated and fertilized to maintain reference conditions as promulgated by ASCE (2005) and FAO (1996). Irrigation was by surface flood in 1989 through 1994, and by subsurface drip irrigation after 1994. Sensors were replicated and intercompared between replicates and with data from nearby weather stations, which were sometimes used for gap filling. Quality control and assurance methods are described by Evett et al. (2018).
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on maize ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks.

This dataset contains 15-minute mean weather data from the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) for all days in each year since 1988. The data are from sensors placed at 2-m height over a level, grass surface mowed to not exceed 12 cm height and irrigated and fertilized to maintain reference conditions as promulgated by Allen et al. (2005, 1998). Irrigation was by surface flood in 1989 through 1994, and by subsurface drip irrigation after 1994. Sensors were replicated and intercompared between replicates and with data from nearby weather stations, which were sometimes used for gap filling. Quality control and assurance methods are described by Evett et al. (2018). Data from a duplicate sensor were used to fill gaps in data from the primary sensor using appropriate regression relationships. Gap filling was also accomplished using sensors deployed at one of the four large weighing lysimeters immediately west of the weather station, or using sensors at other nearby stations when reliable regression relationships could be developed. The primary paper describes details of the sensors used and methods of testing, calibration, inter-comparison, and use. The weather data include air temperature (C) and relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), solar irradiance (W m-2), barometric pressure (kPa), and precipitation (rain and snow in mm). Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is <0.3% and flat. The mean annual precipitation is ~470 mm, the 20-year pan evaporation record indicates ~2,600 mm Class A pan evaporation per year, and winds are typically from the South and Southwest. The climate is semi-arid with ~70% (350 mm) of the annual precipitation occurring from May to September, during which period the pan evaporation averages ~1520 mm.

https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526466
This dataset contains soil water content data developed from neutron probe readings taken in access tubes in two of the four large, precision weighing lysimeters and in the fields surrounding each lysimeter that were planted to winter wheat at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) beginning in 1989. Data in each spreadsheet are for one winter wheat growing season, either 1989-1990, 1991-1992, or 1992-1993. Other readings taken in those years for other crops are reported elsewhere. Data for the 1989-1990 season and the 1992-1993 season are from the northwest (NW) and southwest (SW) weighing lysimeters and surrounding fields. Data for the 1991-1992 season are from the northeast (NE) and southeast (SE) weighing lysimeters and surrounding fields. Readings were taken periodically with a field-calibrated neutron probe at depths from 10 cm to 230 cm (maximum of 190 cm depth in the lysimeters) in 20-cm depth increments. Periods between readings were typically one to two weeks, sometimes longer according to experimental design and need for data. Field calibrations in the Pullman soil series were done every few years. Calibrations typically produced a regression equation with RMSE <= 0.01 m3 m-3 (e.g., Evett and Steiner, 1995). Data were used to guide irrigation scheduling to achieve full or deficit irrigation as required by the experimental design. Data may be used to calculate the soil profile water content in mm of water from the surface to the maximum depth of reading. Profile water content differences between reading times in the same access tube are considered the change in soil water storage during the period in question and may be used to compute evapotranspiration (ET) using the soil water balance equation: ET = (change in storage + P + I + F + R, where P is precipitation during the period, I is irrigation during the period, F is soil water flux (drainage) out of the bottom of the soil profile during the period, and R is the sum of runon and runoff during the period.

393,Snowtography Dataset,dataset,"Data generated by Snowtography field stations consists of automated daily images of snow depth taken by trail cameras, automated hourly soil moisture, and at some stations, automated hourly weather data such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, and solar radiation.  Each station collects snow depth data for 25-50 distinct locations within a radius of a few hundred meters and soil moisture at 5-20 locations.  Weather information at one or two locations.  Additional data include snow density measurements taken manually during field site visits every few weeks.

There are currently 5 snowtography stations in Arizona and one in Colorado, with 3 more slated for installation in 2022 and 3 more in 2023.  The oldest stations date from 2017.  Some stations are entirely owned by ARS, while most are collaborative efforts with University, industry, and/or NGO partners.  

My current interest to to assemble, store, and share these data in a central, homogenized way.  Ideally the data would be placed in geospatial and meteorological context with relevant layers such as elevation, mean weather, forest type, etc.

https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/growth-and-yield-data-bushland-texas-winter-wheat-datasets. Accessed 2022-06-01
This dataset consists of growth and yield data for each season when winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). In each season, winter wheat was grown for grain on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with the fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system. Irrigation protocols described as full were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. Irrigation protocols described as deficit typically involved irrigations to establish the crop early in the season, followed by reduced or absent irrigations later in the season (typically in the later winter and spring).
The growth and yield data include plant population density, height (except in 1989-1990), plant row width, leaf area index, growth stage, total above-ground biomass, leaf and stem biomass, head mass (when present), kernel number, and final yield. Data are from replicate samples in the field and non-destructive (except for final harvest) measurements on the weighing lysimeters. In most cases yield data are available from both manual sampling on replicate plots in each field and from machine harvest.
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on winter wheat ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.",opensource,excel,Excel,server,Data are in the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons,public,ARS,Evett_Steven,100gb,observational,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA,"Growth and Yield Data for the Bushland, Texas, Winter Wheat Datasets","Growth and Yield Data for the Bushland, Texas, Winter Wheat Datasets",Yield

In 2013, 2016, and 2018, two lysimeters and their respective fields (NE and SE) were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields (NW and SW) were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field.

https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526334
This dataset contains water balance data for each growing season (year) when maize was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Maize was grown for grain on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1989, 1990, and 1994. In 2013, 2016, and 2018, maize was grown on four lysimeters; two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is <1% and flat.
The water balance data consist of 15-minute and daily amounts of evapotranspiration (ET), dew/frost fall, precipitation (rain/snow), irrigation, scale counterweight adjustment, and emptying of drainage tanks, all in mm. The values are the result of a rigorous quality control process involving algorithms for detecting dew/frost accumulations, and precipitation (rain and snow). Changes in lysimeter mass due to emptying of drainage tanks, counterweight adjustment, maintenance activity, and harvest are accounted for such that ET values are minimally affected. The ET data should be considered to be the best values offered in these datasets. Even though ET data are also presented in the ""lysimeter"" datasets, the values herein are the result of a more rigorous quality control process. Dew and frost accumulation varies from year to year and seasonally within a year, and it is affected by lysimeter surface condition [bare soil, tillage condition, residue amount and orientation (flat or standing), etc.]. Particularly during winter and depending on humidity and cloud cover, dew and frost accumulation sometimes accounts for an appreciable percentage of total daily ET.
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on maize ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), by OPENET, and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.",opensource,excel,Excel,server,Data are on the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons,public,ARS,Evett_Steven,100gb,continuous,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,NA,"Evapotranspiration, Irrigation, Dew/frost - Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets","Evapotranspiration, Irrigation, Dew/frost - Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets",NA

References in identified publications were further screened for additional publications relating to use of archived soils. Only publications in English or with English abstracts were considered. Identified publications were vetted to ensure archived soils were experimentally used in each study. For purposes of this compilation, archived soils were designated as those that had been stored for five or more years. A total of 245 publications were identified. Each publication was reviewed for key metadata, including publication year, age of oldest sample, and sample collection location. Land use associated with archived soil, along with the subject of each investigation were also recorded. Compiled metadata were transcribed into a single spreadsheet with sortable columns. An abstract for each publication was included in the spreadsheet, and when available, a digital object identifier was recorded to facilitate electronic access. Compiled information in the spreadsheet provides researchers a valuable resource for documenting use of soil archives globally.

The Current Research Information System (CRIS) provides documentation and reporting for ongoing agricultural, food science, human nutrition, and forestry research, education and extension activities for the United States Department of Agriculture, with a focus on the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) grant programs. Projects are conducted or sponsored by USDA research agencies, state agricultural experiment stations, land-grant universities, other cooperating state institutions, and participants in NIFA-administered grant programs, including Small Business Innovation Research, and Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. The Planning, Accountability, & Reporting Staff office is responsible for maintaining CRIS.

CRIS was authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture in 1966 to document the publicly-funded activities of the USDA/State agricultural and forestry research system.

ClimateNA also uses the scale-free data as a baseline to downscale historical and future climate variables for individual years and periods between 1901 and 2100. ClimateNA covers entire North America. It is scale free and can read many types of inputs and can create outputs to match the same scale and dimensions. It can use up to 13 GCMs ensembled under 4 RCPs different to produce different results.

https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/agronomic-calendars-bushland-texas-winter-wheat-datasets
This dataset consists of agronomic calendars for each growing season (year) when winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Winter wheat was grown for grain on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with the fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations designated as full were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. Irrigations designated as deficit typically involved full irrigation to establish the crop followed by limited or no irrigation in the later winter and spring. A crop calendar for each season lists by date the pertinent agronomic and maintenance operations (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest). For each season there is a crop calendar for the two lysimeters. In the 1989-1990 seasons the NW and SW lysimeters and fields were planted to winter wheat, and in the 1991-1992 season the NE and SE lysimeters and fields were planted to winter wheat.
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.",opensource,excel,Excel,server,Data are in the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons,public,ARS,Evett_Steven,100gb,observational,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA,"Agronomic Calendars for the Bushland, Texas Winter Wheat Datasets","Agronomic Calendars for the Bushland, Texas Winter Wheat Datasets",Crop

Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. A crop calendar for each season lists by date the pertinent agronomic and maintenance operations (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest). For each year there is a crop calendar for the two east lysimeters (NE and SE) and another calendar for the two west lysimeters (NW and SW).
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on maize ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), by OPENET, and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.",opensource,excel,Excel,server,Data are on the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons,public,ARS,Evett_Steven,100gb,observational,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA,"Agronomic Calendars for the Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets","Agronomic Calendars for the Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets",Crop
