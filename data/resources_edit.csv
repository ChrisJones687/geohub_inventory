FUSION is a suite of software developed by station scientists to visualize and analyze airborne lidar data. The visualization components display project data using a 2D display typical of geographic information systems (GIS). Users interact with the 2D display to select subsets of LIDAR data for display in an interactive 3D visualization environment allowing the examination of spatially-explicit data subsets including lidar returns, images, surface models, and 3D objects (e.g. tree models). To support complex analyses, FUSION includes a comprehensive set of command-line tools that help users assess the overall quality and completeness of lidar data, develop a basic set of derived products, and automate a variety of processing and analysis tasks. FUSION also provides workflow tools to automate the application of these tools over large lidar datasets.

The analysis and visualization system consists of two main programs, FUSION and LDV (LIDAR data viewer), and a collection of task-specific command line programs.","owned",NA,NA,NA,NA,"desktop","hybrid",2022-05-11 16:00:00,"fs_SC_Clemson","FS",NA,NA,"Reid_Shawna","3b724ee7-ec2e-4d94-8673-b0628cf3bf0d",2022-05-11 15:11:02,NA,2022-05-11 22:09:31,"CRAFT_Admin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SC","Clemson",NA,NA,NA

HymenopteraMine is a data mining tool that integrates all of the genomes in HGD with biological data from a variety of sources. The goal of HymenopteraMine is to accelerate genomics analysis by enabling researchers without scripting skills to create and export customized annotation datasets merged with their own research data for use in downstream analyses. HymenopteraMine facilitates cross-species data mining based on orthology and supports meta-analyses by tracking identifiers across gene sets and genome assemblies.","shared","other","several","other","unknown",NA,"hybrid",2022-05-31 17:00:00,"ARS_MS_Stoneville","ARS",NA,NA,"Allen_Margaret","fdcbf5a6-6749-46ff-8f4c-764b7b8dc147",2022-05-31 19:51:18,NA,2022-05-31 19:51:18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"unknown","observational",NA,NA,NA,"MS","Stoneville",0,1,0

It consists of a client program that interacts with a server program. The client program runs on an embedded computer on the center pivot and acquires data from wireless sensors systems, including wireless infrared thermometers that sense crop canopy temperature, wireless soil sensing systems that sense soil temperature, water content, and bulk electrical conductivity, and a wireless weather station. The client program applies algorithms to these temporal-spatial data in order to develop prescription maps that tell the VRI center pivot where to irrigated and how much water to apply to meet crop water needs. The client program has a simple graphical user interface that is not ordinarily used. The server program communicates with the client program over a wireless interface (typically a cellular modem) and receives the prescription map and presents it to the farmer/irrigation manager for approval. The server program also facilitates the description of the center pivot (total length of later pipe, number of spans between wheels, number and spacing of VRI nozzles, etc.) and communicates that with the client program once the user has input the necessary data on center pivot dimensions, etc. The server program has a complex graphical user interface facilitating the description of multiple center pivot irrigation machines, downloading Google Earth images of the center pivot locations, downloading soils data from the NRCS SORGGO database, modifying prescription maps at the user's discretion, mapping of X, Y, Z data such as elevation, yield, etc. using kriging algorithms, visualization of temperature, crop water stress, and soil water content data, and many other functions.","owned",NA,NA,NA,NA,"other","public",2022-05-31 17:00:00,"ARS_TX_Bushland","ARS",NA,NA,"Evett_Steven","38fa7aa3-75cb-434b-8b40-9b2bc4b9735e",2022-05-31 21:35:51,NA,2022-05-31 21:35:51,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The server application has a desktop interface, networks with the client application, acts as a data input/collection tool, and acts as a continuous monitoring tool.

It uses irrigation data for irrigation applied to the soil surface or at some depth below the surface (buried drip irrigation lines). It uses input data of weather (solar irradiance, wind speed, air temperature and humidity) at daily or subdaily (e.g., hourly, half-hourly, 15-minute) intervals, irrigation and precipitation (start time, stop time, amount), leaf area index, and rooting pattern. It also uses input data files of soil hydraulic properties of different soil layers (horizons). Its soil discretization allows for variable vertical distances between computational nodes, including distances as small as 1 mm near the surface. It outputs evapotranspiration, energy balance components, radiation balance components, soil heat flux, soil water content, soil temperature, etc. on user-chosen intervals (typically half-hourly). It is used for investigations of crop water use, evaporation from soil surface, effects of subsurface irrigation compared with surface irrigation, effects of weather and interannual weather variations, etc.","opensource",NA,NA,NA,NA,"desktop","public",2022-05-31 17:00:00,"ARS_TX_Bushland","ARS",NA,NA,"Evett_Steven","38fa7aa3-75cb-434b-8b40-9b2bc4b9735e",2022-05-31 21:35:51,NA,2022-05-31 21:35:51,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"TX","Bushland",0,0,1

Information on growth cycle, relative water use, plant architecture, seeding depth, forage quality, pollination characteristics, and nutrient cycling are included for most crop species.

The Cover Crop Chart is easy to use, requiring only Adobe Acrobat software. Using the chart as a guide, users can select individual crop species by clicking on the name which will direct them to additional information about the selected crop.

The program has been expanded to provide crop sequence information on two research projects (Phase II and Phase III) conducted from 1998 through 2005 at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory. Information on crop production, economics, plant diseases, weeds, water use, and surface soil properties has been expanded to aid producers in their evaluation of management risks associated with different crop sequences. The user can select which group of crops are of most interest in either Phase II (above-average precipitation and a higher percentage of cool-season crops) or Phase III (below-average precipitation and a higher percentage of warm-season crops). Then choose the residue crop and expected crop from pull-down menus to view estimated yields and summary statements about production economics, disease, soil water, weeds, and surface soil properties. Information on 16 crops are covered by the two research projects, four of which were common to both. Photographs of weeds and insects along with additional resource information (e.g. many related Internet links) are also included.

Version 3.1 contains the previous version, 3.0, and adds new information gathered from additional cropping sequence research, as well as supplemental information related to use of annual crops as cover crops.

References in identified publications were further screened for additional publications relating to use of archived soils. Only publications in English or with English abstracts were considered. Identified publications were vetted to ensure archived soils were experimentally used in each study. For purposes of this compilation, archived soils were designated as those that had been stored for five or more years. A total of 245 publications were identified. Each publication was reviewed for key metadata, including publication year, age of oldest sample, and sample collection location. Land use associated with archived soil, along with the subject of each investigation were also recorded. Compiled metadata were transcribed into a single spreadsheet with sortable columns. An abstract for each publication was included in the spreadsheet, and when available, a digital object identifier was recorded to facilitate electronic access. Compiled information in the spreadsheet provides researchers a valuable resource for documenting use of soil archives globally.

Driven by daily meteorological data, Ages simulates plant-soil-water-nutrient interactions with dynamic plant development and growth based on the Unified Plant Growth Model (UPGM) and layered soils. Water, solutes and particles are routed laterally among Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) and stream reaches with topology and routing generated by the Catchment areas delineation (Cadel) tool for each project. The OMS Console can be used for model deployment, providing a basic runtime interface. The open-source code is distributed via repositories, and an AgES executable (.jar) file and essential libraries are available to users who do not need the source code. AgES model-as-a-service is deployed using the Cloud Services Innovation Platform (CSIP) on public cloud platforms and private servers.

"491",520,"9c4a50f5-0be8-4c0a-8168-71edbdfe91ae","Climate Information System","inhouse","The NASS Climate Information System (CIS; https://nass.agroclimate.org/) is a web-based information system, designed for internal use, to systematically monitor climate indicators and alert when climate anomalies are detected in regions of interest to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. The climate indicators selected for monitoring by the system are mostly related to temperature and soil moisture conditions including growing degree days, heat stress degree days, nighttime temperature, and water stress indices in addition to daily air temperature and precipitation. Outputs are provided in the form of tables and maps and the system can also send automated alerts when anomalous climate conditions are observed in a region of interest.  
Source:  Fraisse et al (20XX) Information technology
Two gridded data sources were selected for providing weather and climate data to the system: The Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis. The SoilGrids global gridded soil information system was selected to provide the necessary soil properties information.
The NASS-CIS was designed to take full advantage of the big data scenario and abundance of information generated on a daily basis by the system. In order to accomplish this objective, it was developed following two main concepts: low coupling and scalability.  A modular approach with multiple independent modules with a low degree of interdependence between the modules was implemented. The low coupling and scalability approaches used for designing and developing the NASS-CIS resulted in a dynamic system that can integrate different technologies, fulfilling its data deliverance purpose while fostering the development and integration of new features. Its current configuration comprehends relational databases with support to geospatial data, data downloading and processing routines, simulation models, application programming interfaces (APIs), and web applications (Figure 1).
Dynamic data collection takes place through scripts developed in R language in non-cloud data processing servers, where the Linux Cron daemon holds the execution agenda and is responsible for triggering hourly and daily tasks. The Linux Cron daemon is a long-running process that executes commands at specific dates and times (Perondi et al., 2020). Once collected and normalized, the data is transmitted to cloud database servers. PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org) with geospatial support provided by the PostGIS extension (https://postgis.net) is used to manage the databases. Application programming interfaces (APIs) developed using diverse technologies, such as NodeJS and Python, create the communication link between the front-end applications, simulation models, and databases. The Kubernetes orchestrator is used to automate and manage the APIs deployment and scalability. Originally designed by Google, Kubernetes is a platform for automating applications' deployments and scaling across servers (https://kubernetes.io).
Models used to simulate crop phenological development and water stress models, as well as other indicators calculations, are encapsulated by stateless containers and run in the Google Cloud Run platform (GCR). The models are loaded when an HTTP request is received from the APIs and unloaded after its execution completes. The GCR is a service based on serverless computing, which acts as an evolution of cloud computing reducing costs and removing the infrastructure management complexity. Web application interfaces, which connect the final users to the NASS-CIS solutions, were developed using the Angular (https://angular.io) and WordPress (https://wordpress.org) frameworks. While WordPress serves as the website content management system, Angular is the base technology behind the monitoring tools. The NGINX web server (https://nginx.org) controls the access and routing of the website and tools.","shared",NA,NA,NA,NA,"monitor","private",2022-06-01 16:00:00,"NASS_DC_Washington","NASS",NA,NA,"Guindin_Noemi","7d644ebd-3841-43a7-8458-92629284f5bd",2022-06-01 18:38:45,NA,2022-06-01 18:38:45,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DC","Washington",0,0,1

Users can freely download this database structure for each HUC12 watershed where the core data structure has been developed. 

A high resolution elevation dataset is then added by the user to the data structure. A set of custom-built ArcGIS tools enables the user to perform a wide variety of conservation planning within each HUC12 watershed, including:
Hydro-conditioning of the input LIDAR-derived digital elevation model
Stream network and catchment development
Field characterization (tile-drainage estimation, by-field slope statistics, and runoff risk assessment)
Within field conservation siting: bioreactors, grassed waterways, contour buffer strips, controlled drainage, WASCOBs
Below field conservation siting: nutrient removal wetlands
Riparian siting: saturated buffers, riparian buffer design.

For every Farm Service Agency (FSA) project, staff must conduct an environmental review and determine the need for a site-specific FSA-850. Preparing a site-specific FSA-850 can involve navigating a lengthy process that includes visiting greater than 10 different external websites to collect geospatial information for activities that require the use of a supported categorical exclusion. The completion of an FSA-850 for an activity with a greater potential for impacts to legally protected resources requires a “supported categorical exclusion” that currently takes between 60 to 180 minutes to complete the paper process, while activities utilizing a listed categorical exclusion take approx. 15 minutes to complete. 

The development of a digitized and automated environmental compliance tool will greatly speed completion of FSA-850s. Further, it would facilitate consistent field staff decision-making and ensure compliance with law/policy, shielding the agency and producers from litigation. ENV is developing an web-based tool to streamline the required environmental compliance for FSA projects, by automating the current paper form, the FSA-850, and streamlining the geospatial analysis required by utilizing web services to bring all the external geospatial information into a single tool. 

This tool would have four main components: 
•	Geospatial visualization of regulatory data sources, 
•	Screening for any available and applicable Programmatic FSA-850s,
•	Digitized version of the FSA-850 form, and 
•	Reportable database.

The following are the external geodatabases that will be incorporated into the tool:

This dataset consists of agronomic calendars for each growing season (year) when winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Winter wheat was grown for grain on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with the fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations designated as full were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. Irrigations designated as deficit typically involved full irrigation to establish the crop followed by limited or no irrigation in the later winter and spring. A crop calendar for each season lists by date the pertinent agronomic and maintenance operations (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest). For each season there is a crop calendar for the two lysimeters. In the 1989-1990 seasons the NW and SW lysimeters and fields were planted to winter wheat, and in the 1991-1992 season the NE and SE lysimeters and fields were planted to winter wheat.
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.","opensource","excel","Excel","server","Data are in the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons",NA,"public",2022-06-01 17:00:00,"ARS_TX_Bushland","ARS",NA,NA,"Evett_Steven","2101701a-47bc-49ec-8b31-2d7bc4f7d2b0",2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"100gb","observational",NA,NA,NA,"TX","Bushland",0,1,0

Irrigation protocols described as full were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. Irrigation protocols described as deficit typically involved irrigations to establish the crop early in the season, followed by reduced or absent irrigations later in the season (typically in the later winter and spring).
The growth and yield data include plant population density, height (except in 1989-1990), plant row width, leaf area index, growth stage, total above-ground biomass, leaf and stem biomass, head mass (when present), kernel number, and final yield. Data are from replicate samples in the field and non-destructive (except for final harvest) measurements on the weighing lysimeters. In most cases yield data are available from both manual sampling on replicate plots in each field and from machine harvest.

[ NOTE – 2022/05/06: this dataset supersedes the earlier version https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1482548 ].
This dataset contains 15-minute mean weather data from the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) for all days in each year since 1988. The data are from sensors placed at 2-m height over a level, grass surface mowed to not exceed 12 cm height and irrigated and fertilized to maintain reference conditions as promulgated by Allen et al. (2005, 1998). Irrigation was by surface flood in 1989 through 1994, and by subsurface drip irrigation after 1994. Sensors were replicated and intercompared between replicates and with data from nearby weather stations, which were sometimes used for gap filling. Quality control and assurance methods are described by Evett et al. (2018). Data from a duplicate sensor were used to fill gaps in data from the primary sensor using appropriate regression relationships. Gap filling was also accomplished using sensors deployed at one of the four large weighing lysimeters immediately west of the weather station, or using sensors at other nearby stations when reliable regression relationships could be developed. The primary paper describes details of the sensors used and methods of testing, calibration, inter-comparison, and use. The weather data include air temperature (C) and relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), solar irradiance (W m-2), barometric pressure (kPa), and precipitation (rain and snow in mm). Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is <0.3% and flat. The mean annual precipitation is ~470 mm, the 20-year pan evaporation record indicates ~2,600 mm Class A pan evaporation per year, and winds are typically from the South and Southwest. The climate is semi-arid with ~70% (350 mm) of the annual precipitation occurring from May to September, during which period the pan evaporation averages ~1520 mm.

Readings were taken periodically with a field-calibrated neutron probe at depths from 10 cm to 230 cm (maximum of 190 cm depth in the lysimeters) in 20-cm depth increments. Periods between readings were typically one to two weeks, sometimes longer according to experimental design and need for data. Field calibrations in the Pullman soil series were done every few years. Calibrations typically produced a regression equation with RMSE <= 0.01 m3 m-3 (e.g., Evett and Steiner, 1995). Data were used to guide irrigation scheduling to achieve full or deficit irrigation as required by the experimental design. Data may be used to calculate the soil profile water content in mm of water from the surface to the maximum depth of reading. Profile water content differences between reading times in the same access tube are considered the change in soil water storage during the period in question and may be used to compute evapotranspiration (ET) using the soil water balance equation: ET = (change in storage + P + I + F + R, where P is precipitation during the period, I is irrigation during the period, F is soil water flux (drainage) out of the bottom of the soil profile during the period, and R is the sum of runon and runoff during the period. Typically, R is taken as zero because the fields were furrow diked to prevent runon and runoff during most of each growing season.","opensource","excel","Excel","server","Data are in the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons",NA,"public",2022-06-01 17:00:00,"ARS_TX_Bushland","ARS",NA,NA,"Evett_Steven","2101701a-47bc-49ec-8b31-2d7bc4f7d2b0",2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"100gb","observational",NA,NA,NA,"TX","Bushland",0,1,0

This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for each growing season (two-year period) when winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Winter wheat was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, calibrated to NIST standards (Howell et al., 1995). Each lysimeter was in the center of a 4.44 ha square field on which wheat was also grown (Evett et al., 2000). The two fields were contiguous and arranged with one directly north of the other. See the resource titled ""Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas"" for UTM geographic coordinates for field and lysimeter locations. Wheat was planted in Autumn and grown over the winter in 1989-1990, 1991-1992, and 1992-1993. Agronomic calendar for the each of the three growing seasons list by date the agronomic practices applied, severe weather, and activities (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest) in and on lysimeters that could influence crop growth, water use, and lysimeter data. These include fertilizer and pesticide applications. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system equipped with pressure regulated low pressure sprays (mid-elevation spray application, MESA). Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a field-calibrated (Evett and Steiner, 1995) neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field. The lysimeters and fields were planted to the same plant density, row spacing, tillage depth (by hand on the lysimeters and by machine in the fields), and fertilizer and pesticide applications. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation, dew and frost accumulation, and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and humidity, radiant energy (incoming and reflected, typically both shortwave and longwave), surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil temperature, all of which are reported at 15-minute intervals. Instruments used changed from season to season, which is another reason that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required. The Bushland weighing lysimeter research program was described by Evett et al. (2016), and lysimeter design is described by Marek et al. (1988).

This dataset consists of weather data for each year when alfalfa was grown for dry hay at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Alfalfa was grown, cut and field cured for dry hay on four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with the fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system equipped with mid elevation spray applicators. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field.
The weather data include solar irradiance, barometric pressure, air temperature and relative humidity, and wind speed determined using sensors placed at 2-m height over a level, grass surface mowed to not exceed 12 cm height and irrigated and fertilized to maintain reference conditions as promulgated by ASCE (2005) and FAO (1996). Irrigation was by surface flood in 1989 through 1994, and by subsurface drip irrigation after 1994. Sensors were replicated and intercompared between replicates and with data from nearby weather stations, which were sometimes used for gap filling. Quality control and assurance methods are described by Evett et al. (2018).
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on alfalfa ET, ""tall crop"" (alfalfa) reference ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), by OPENET, and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.","opensource","excel","Excel","server","Data are on the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons",NA,"public",2022-06-01 17:00:00,"ARS_TX_Bushland","ARS",NA,NA,"Evett_Steven","2101701a-47bc-49ec-8b31-2d7bc4f7d2b0",2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"100gb","continuous",NA,NA,NA,"TX","Bushland",0,1,0

This dataset consists of four years of weighing lysimeter data for alfalfa grown at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) in 1996 through 1999. Alfalfa was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure mass, which was converted to relative soil water storage with 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Although a quality control process was used, the ET data in this dataset are considered raw data. Advanced algorithms for detection of precipitation, dew and frost were applied in a separate process to determine ET values that are reported in files in a dataset entitled ""Evapotranspiration and Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Alfalfa Datasets"". Those files have ""water-balance"" in their names. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity, components of the radiation balance (e.g., net radiation, incoming and reflected shortwave, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), incoming and reflected longwave, thermal infrared emitted by the plant/soil surface), soil heat flux, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at certain depths. Not all properties were always sensed in any one year; and instruments used changed from season to season, which are reasons that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required.

This dataset contains water balance data for each year when alfalfa was grown at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL).

Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is <0.3% and flat.
The water balance data consist of 15-minute and daily amounts of evapotranspiration (ET), dew/frost fall, precipitation (rain/snow), irrigation, scale counterweight adjustment, and emptying of drainage tanks, all in mm. The values are the result of a rigorous quality control process involving algorithms for detecting dew/frost accumulations, and precipitation (rain and snow). Changes in lysimeter mass due to emptying of drainage tanks, counterweight adjustment, maintenance activity, and harvest are accounted for such that ET values are minimally affected. The ET data should be considered to be the best values offered in these datasets. Even though ET data are also presented in the ""lysimeter"" datasets, the values herein are the result of a more rigorous quality control process. Dew and frost accumulation varies from year to year and seasonally within a year, and it is affected by lysimeter surface condition [bare soil, tillage condition, residue amount and orientation (flat or standing), etc.]. Particularly during winter and depending on humidity and cloud cover, dew and frost accumulation sometimes accounts for an appreciable percentage of total daily ET.

This dataset consists of six years of weighing lysimeter data for six seasons of maize grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) for 1989, 1990, 1994, 2013, 2016, and 2018. Maize was grown on four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure mass, which was converted to relative soil water storage with 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Although a quality control process was used, the ET data in this dataset are considered raw data. Advanced algorithms for detection of precipitation, dew and frost were applied in a separate process to determine ET values that are reported in files in a dataset entitled ""Evapotranspiration and Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets"". Those files have ""water-balance"" in their names. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity, components of the radiation balance (e.g., net radiation, incoming and reflected shortwave, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), incoming and reflected longwave, thermal infrared emitted by the plant/soil surface), soil heat flux, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at certain depths. Not all properties were always sensed in any one year; and instruments used changed from season to season, which are reasons that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required.
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on maize ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), by OPENET, and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.","opensource","excel","Excel","server","Data are on the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons",NA,"public",2022-06-01 17:00:00,"ARS_TX_Bushland","ARS",NA,NA,"Evett_Steven","2101701a-47bc-49ec-8b31-2d7bc4f7d2b0",2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"100gb","continuous",NA,NA,NA,"TX","Bushland",0,1,0

This dataset consists of growth and yield data for each year when maize was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Maize was grown for grain on four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with the fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1989, 1990, and 1994. In 2013, 2016, and 2018, two lysimeters and their respective fields (NE and SE) were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields (NW and SW) were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field.
The growth and yield data include plant population density, height, plant row width, leaf area index, growth stage, total above-ground biomass, leaf and stem biomass, ear mass (when present), kernel number, and final yield. Data are from replicate samples in the field and non-destructive (except for final harvest) measurements on the weighing lysimeters. In most cases yield data are available from both manual sampling on replicate plots in each field and from machine harvest.

The weather data include solar irradiance, barometric pressure, air temperature and relative humidity, and wind speed determined using sensors placed at 2-m height over a level, grass surface mowed to not exceed 12 cm height and irrigated and fertilized to maintain reference conditions as promulgated by ASCE (2005) and FAO (1996). Irrigation was by surface flood in 1989 through 1994, and by subsurface drip irrigation after 1994. Sensors were replicated and intercompared between replicates and with data from nearby weather stations, which were sometimes used for gap filling. Quality control and assurance methods are described by Evett et al. (2018).

This dataset contains soil water content data developed from neutron probe readings taken in access tubes in each of the four large, precision weighing lysimeters and in the fields surrounding each lysimeter at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) beginning in 1989. Readings were taken periodically with a field-calibrated neutron probe at depths from 10 cm to 230 cm (maximum of 190 cm depth in the lysimeters) in 20-cm depth increments. Periods between readings were typically one to two weeks, sometimes longer according to experimental design and need for data. Field calibrations in the Pullman soil series were done every few years. Calibrations typically produced a regression equation with RMSE <= 0.01 m3 m-3. Data were used to guide irrigation scheduling to achieve full or deficit irrigation as required by the experimental design. Data may be used to calculate the soil profile water content in mm of water from the surface to the maximum depth of reading. Profile water content differences between reading times in the same access tube are considered the change in soil water storage during the period in question and may be used to compute evapotranspiration (ET) using the soil water balance equation: ET = (change in storage + P + I + F + R, where P is precipitation during the period, I is irrigation during the period, F is soil water flux (drainage) out of the bottom of the soil profile during the period, and R is the sum of runon and runoff during the period. Typically, R is taken as zero because the fields were furrow diked to prevent runon and runoff during most of each growing season.","opensource","excel","Excel","server","Data are on the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons",NA,"public",2022-06-01 17:00:00,"ARS_TX_Bushland","ARS",NA,NA,"Evett_Steven","2101701a-47bc-49ec-8b31-2d7bc4f7d2b0",2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"100gb","observational",NA,NA,NA,"TX","Bushland",0,1,0

This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for each growing season (year) when maize (Zea mays, L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Maize was grown for grain on between two and four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four fields were contiguous and arranged in four quadrants, which were labeled northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). See the resource titled ""Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas"" for UTM geographic coordinates for field and lysimeter locations. Maize was grown on only the NE and SE fields in 1989 and 1990, and on all four fields in 1994, 2013, 2016, and 2018. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1989, 1990, and 1994, although the system was equipped with various application technologies such as high-pressure impact sprinklers, low pressure spray applications, and low energy precision applicators (LEPA). In 2013, 2016, and 2018, two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system equipped with spray applicators. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field. The number and spacing of neutron probe reading locations changed through the years (additional sites were added), which is one reason why subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries are needed. The lysimeters and fields were planted to the same plant density, row spacing, tillage depth (by hand on the lysimeters and by machine in the fields), and fertilizer and pesticide applications. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation, dew and frost accumulation, and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and humidity, radiant energy (incoming and reflected, typically both shortwave and longwave), surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil temperature, all of which are reported at 15-minute intervals. Instruments used changed from season to season, which is another reason that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required.

Important conventions concerning the data-time correspondence, sign conventions, and terminology specific to the USDA ARS, Bushland, TX, field operations are given in the resource titled ""Conventions for Bushland, TX, Weighing Lysimeter Datasets"".

There are six datasets in this collection. Common symbols and abbreviations used in the datasets are defined in the resource titled, ""Symbols and Abbreviations for Bushland, TX, Weighing Lysimeter Datasets"". Datasets consist of Excel (xlsx) files. Each xlsx file contains an Introductory tab that explains the other tabs, lists the authors, describes conventions and symbols used and lists any instruments used. The remaining tabs in a file consist of dictionary and data tabs. There is a dictionary tab for every data tab. The name of the dictionary tab contains the name of the corresponding data tab. Tab names are unique so that if individual tabs were saved to CSV files, each CSV file in the entire collection would have a different name.","opensource","excel","Excel","server","Data are on the USDA ARS NAL Ag Data Commons",NA,"public",2022-06-01 17:00:00,"ARS_TX_Bushland","ARS",NA,NA,"Evett_Steven","2101701a-47bc-49ec-8b31-2d7bc4f7d2b0",2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,2022-06-07 14:27:44,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"100gb","continuous",NA,NA,NA,"TX","Bushland",0,1,0

I encourage you to explore this system to learn more about what GADAS can do for you.

The International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) is part of the Global Market Analysis (GMA) within the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), an agency within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). FAS-IPAD uses satellite imagery and remote sensing data to assist in its agricultural estimates of global crop conditions. The division provides monthly estimates of area, yield and production for 17 distinct commodities in over 160 countries around the world, including post-disaster assessments. GADAS is a powerful visualization tool based on an ArcGIS platform that enables FAS-IPAD analysts, and other users, to rapidly assess real-time crop conditions using a wide variety of data layers from a multitude of sources.

GADAS integrates a vast array of highly detailed data streams to include daily precipitation data, vegetation index, crop masks, land cover data, irrigation and water data, elevation and infrastructure, political data, and much more. In addition, FAS-IPAD has partnered with the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) in Hawaii to incorporate real-time data streams into GADAS for worldwide monitoring, tracking, and pre- and post-disaster agricultural assessments resulting from hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, droughts, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.","owned",NA,NA,NA,NA,"desktop","hybrid",2022-06-07 16:00:00,"FAS_DC_Washington","FAS",NA,NA,"McWilliams_Denise","e5a0a622-2771-45fc-8365-9e4376102564",2022-06-07 16:47:03,NA,2022-06-07 16:47:03,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DC","Washington",0,0,1

Services
Through the Ag Data Commons, the USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL) provides services to make USDA funded research data systems and data products Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Critical functions the Ag Data Commons provides include:

Scientific metadata creation and curation
Public access to data through a catalog of USDA funded research and public APIs
Data repository for long-term archiving (as required to support DOI service)
The Ag Data Commons is a general repository for research data related to food and agriculture, which enables the USDA’s compliance with both public access and open data requirements to make federally funded research data open, accessible, and machine-readable. Services offered increase discoverability for open agricultural research data and provide a repository for data without a discipline-specific repository.

The potential benefit of this approach is collecting data at the commercial scale with many replicates. As applied researchers seeking to provide recommendations to the grass seed industry, we often extrapolate experimental data from small field plot research with minimal replicates to inform recommendations. A robust dataset from commercial farms across Oregon will provide novel insights and complement past and future experimental small-plot research. Our goal is to analyze regional trends from commercial grass seed farms, linking various management practices (crop rotation, soil fertility, adjacent crops) to pest outbreaks, crop damage, and seed yield. Significant trends will be shared with the Oregon grass seed industry, which produces nearly 80 percent of the world’s grass seed. This work will also help Oregon State University and USDA-ARS researchers identify critical areas for future research. Our approach will be to work with grass seed companies, trained fieldmen, and growers on collecting data from their farms throughout the growing season using a survey tool product (ArcGIS Survey123). Types of survey questions will include: 1) contact information, 2) field information and location, 3) management practices, 4) pest observations (insects/slugs/voles, diseases, weeds) and crop damage, 5) harvest information and seed yield (if available). Once the dataset has been procured, spatial models will be developed to understand spatiotemporal trends in grass seed crops.","owned",NA,NA,NA,NA,"input","hybrid",2022-06-10 19:00:00,"ARS_OR_Corvallis","ARS",NA,NA,"Dorman_Seth","770796fc-fe8d-4bb7-8b93-ada42c0bdd12",2022-06-10 12:33:09,NA,2022-06-10 12:33:09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"OR","Corvallis",0,0,1

Pest monitoring provides valuable data on the spatial distribution, abundance, and phenology of important pests to support management decisions. Current methods for disseminating scouting efforts to growers by University Extension and crop advisors vary widely and may lack technological support across regions, resulting in data silos preventing stakeholders from accessing real-time updates on pest outbreaks when management decisions are critical to preventing crop damage. The Oregon Pest Monitoring Network and online ArcGIS Hub webpage contain real-time spatial and temporal trends (ArcGIS Dashboard) for major pest populations in seed crops and vegetables (other commodities) across the Willamette Valley and central and eastern Oregon collected by Oregon State University (OSU) and USDA-ARS researchers. The Oregon Pest Monitoring Network will connect researchers, crop advisors, and growers, facilitating the rapid dissemination of economic pest data for multiple production regions. Moreover, spatiotemporal data collected will be used to develop phenological and predictive models also shared on the ArcGIS Hub webpage (ArcGIS Web App). In addition to real-time pest data and phenology models, management recommendations and pest alerts will be shared on the home page platform (ArcGIS StoryMap). A “Report a Pest” survey (ArcGIS Survey123) is also included in the platform for the public to submit pest observations on commercial farms that will populate the real-time dashboard in addition to regular data submissions collected by University and USDA-ARS researchers.","owned",NA,NA,NA,NA,"dashboard","public",2022-06-10 19:00:00,"ARS_OR_Corvallis","ARS",NA,NA,"Dorman_Seth","770796fc-fe8d-4bb7-8b93-ada42c0bdd12",2022-06-10 12:33:09,NA,2022-06-10 12:33:09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"OR","Corvallis",0,0,1

Each station collects snow depth data for 25-50 distinct locations within a radius of a few hundred meters and soil moisture at 5-20 locations.  Weather information at one or two locations.  Additional data include snow density measurements taken manually during field site visits every few weeks.

There are currently 5 snowtography stations in Arizona and one in Colorado, with 3 more slated for installation in 2022 and 3 more in 2023.  The oldest stations date from 2017.  Some stations are entirely owned by ARS, while most are collaborative efforts with University, industry, and/or NGO partners.  

My current interest to to assemble, store, and share these data in a central, homogenized way.  Ideally the data would be placed in geospatial and meteorological context with relevant layers such as elevation, mean weather, forest type, etc.

The Current Research Information System (CRIS) provides documentation and reporting for ongoing agricultural, food science, human nutrition, and forestry research, education and extension activities for the United States Department of Agriculture, with a focus on the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) grant programs. Projects are conducted or sponsored by USDA research agencies, state agricultural experiment stations, land-grant universities, other cooperating state institutions, and participants in NIFA-administered grant programs, including Small Business Innovation Research, and Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. The Planning, Accountability, & Reporting Staff office is responsible for maintaining CRIS.

CRIS was authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture in 1966 to document the publicly-funded activities of the USDA/State agricultural and forestry research system. The system has expanded to include a number of education, extension and integrated activities. Most CRIS data is available to the public through a number of web sites.

CRIS projects relating to human nutrition are provided annually to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for inclusion in the Human Nutrition Research and Information Management database (HNRIM). In CRIS, these projects are designated as the subfile, ""HNRIMS."" Updates occur annually; therefore, all human nutrition projects in CRIS may not yet be identified for inclusion in the HNRIMS subfile. I am not too familiar with this data collection.
