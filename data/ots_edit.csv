384,Ag Data Commons,ots,"The Ag Data Commons is a public, government, scientific research data catalog and repository available to help the agricultural research community share and discover research data funded by the United States Department of Agriculture and meet Federal open data and public access requirements.

Services
Through the Ag Data Commons, the USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL) provides services to make USDA funded research data systems and data products Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Critical functions the Ag Data Commons provides include:

Scientific metadata creation and curation
Public access to data through a catalog of USDA funded research and public APIs
Data repository for long-term archiving (as required to support DOI service)
The Ag Data Commons is a general repository for research data related to food and agriculture, which enables the USDA’s compliance with both public access and open data requirements to make federally funded research data open, accessible, and machine-readable. Services offered increase discoverability for open agricultural research data and provide a repository for data without a discipline-specific repository. Thus, the Ag Data Commons helps USDA-funded researchers find data of interest and meet publisher requirements to provide access to data associated with publications.
