Transportation data support general mapping and geographic information system technology analysis for applications such as traffic safety, congestion mitigation, disaster planning, and emergency response. The National Map transportation data is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, hydrography, and structures, to produce general reference base maps.

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC) builds and maintains tree canopy cover (TCC) datasets for the conterminous U.S. (CONUS), coastal Alaska (SEAK), Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (PRUSVI). Since the TCC datasets cover all lands including federal, state, and private lands, multiple divisions of the USFS contribute funding supporting the development and production of the datasets. These divisions include the National Forest Systems, State and Private Forestry, and Research and Development. The TCC datasets are Landsat and Sentinel-2 based with a spatial resolution of 30 meters.

The most recent TCC version 2021.4 product suite released in 2023 includes several components.

An annual Science product (direct model outputs, per pixel SE, and model uncertainty) with maps and data for years 2008-2021, that serve multiple user communities.
The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) TCC maps for years 2011, 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2021, that are maintained by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC).

This information can be used in many ways, such as in evaluating wildlife habitat conditions, assessing the sustainability of ecosystem management practices, and supporting planning and decisionmaking activities undertaken by public and private enterprises.

The Forest Service has significantly enhanced the FIA program by changing from a periodic survey to an annual survey, by increasing our capacity to analyze and publish data, and by expanding the scope of our data collection to include an additional suite of attributes on a subsample of our plots such as soils, understory vegetation, tree crown conditions, down woody material, and invasive species.

Detection surveys are the primary method of collecting data on the health of treed areas affected by insects and diseases. Aerial and ground surveys using applications like Digital Mobile Sketch Mapping (DMSM) and Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) Collector Map are conducted annually. Geospatial data collected with these systems is stored in a National Insect and Disease Survey (IDS) database.Various products are available for download below including National Insect and Disease Detection Survey Maps, IDS Geospatial Data , and IDS Acre Summaries. The annual Detection surveys data is also used to produce Forest Insect and Disease Conditions in the United States reports and National Forest Health Conditions & Highlights Interactive Story Maps.
Detection surveys are an efficient and economical method of collecting and reporting data on forest insects, diseases, and other disturbances across State, Private and Federal lands.

The counties where the disease is present and the race identified are displayed visually using ArcGIS. The maps are updated during the growing season to track the rust pathway across the United States.

Over the years, the CDL has gathered and maintained a wealth of cereal rust survey data on her local FileMaker database server. Information from the annual survey is used to update strategies for controlling rust diseases.
