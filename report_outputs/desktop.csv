FUSION is a suite of software developed by station scientists to visualize and analyze airborne lidar data. The visualization components display project data using a 2D display typical of geographic information systems (GIS). Users interact with the 2D display to select subsets of LIDAR data for display in an interactive 3D visualization environment allowing the examination of spatially-explicit data subsets including lidar returns, images, surface models, and 3D objects (e.g. tree models). To support complex analyses, FUSION includes a comprehensive set of command-line tools that help users assess the overall quality and completeness of lidar data, develop a basic set of derived products, and automate a variety of processing and analysis tasks. FUSION also provides workflow tools to automate the application of these tools over large lidar datasets.

The analysis and visualization system consists of two main programs, FUSION and LDV (LIDAR data viewer), and a collection of task-specific command line programs."

It uses irrigation data for irrigation applied to the soil surface or at some depth below the surface (buried drip irrigation lines). It uses input data of weather (solar irradiance, wind speed, air temperature and humidity) at daily or subdaily (e.g., hourly, half-hourly, 15-minute) intervals, irrigation and precipitation (start time, stop time, amount), leaf area index, and rooting pattern. It also uses input data files of soil hydraulic properties of different soil layers (horizons). Its soil discretization allows for variable vertical distances between computational nodes, including distances as small as 1 mm near the surface. It outputs evapotranspiration, energy balance components, radiation balance components, soil heat flux, soil water content, soil temperature, etc. on user-chosen intervals (typically half-hourly).

"50","Crop Sequence Calculator","Decision Support","public","ARS","opensource","The Crop Sequence Calculator (version 3.1) is a user-friendly program that runs directly from a CD-ROM, eliminating the need for additional disk space or installation procedures. The program has been expanded to provide crop sequence information on two research projects (Phase II and Phase III) conducted from 1998 through 2005 at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory. Information on crop production, economics, plant diseases, weeds, water use, and surface soil properties has been expanded to aid producers in their evaluation of management risks associated with different crop sequences. The user can select which group of crops are of most interest in either Phase II (above-average precipitation and a higher percentage of cool-season crops) or Phase III (below-average precipitation and a higher percentage of warm-season crops). Then choose the residue crop and expected crop from pull-down menus to view estimated yields and summary statements about production economics, disease, soil water, weeds, and surface soil properties. Information on 16 crops are covered by the two research projects, four of which were common to both. Photographs of weeds and insects along with additional resource information (e.g. many related Internet links) are also included.

Version 3.1 contains the previous version, 3.0, and adds new information gathered from additional cropping sequence research, as well as supplemental information related to use of annual crops as cover crops.

Hydro-conditioning of the input LIDAR-derived digital elevation model
Stream network and catchment development
Field characterization (tile-drainage estimation, by-field slope statistics, and runoff risk assessment)

The International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) is part of the Global Market Analysis (GMA) within the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), an agency within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). FAS-IPAD uses satellite imagery and remote sensing data to assist in its agricultural estimates of global crop conditions. The division provides monthly estimates of area, yield and production for 17 distinct commodities in over 160 countries around the world, including post-disaster assessments. GADAS is a powerful visualization tool based on an ArcGIS platform that enables FAS-IPAD analysts, and other users, to rapidly assess real-time crop conditions using a wide variety of data layers from a multitude of sources.

GADAS integrates a vast array of highly detailed data streams to include daily precipitation data, vegetation index, crop masks, land cover data, irrigation and water data, elevation and infrastructure, political data, and much more. In addition, FAS-IPAD has partnered with the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) in Hawaii to incorporate real-time data streams into GADAS for worldwide monitoring, tracking, and pre- and post-disaster agricultural assessments resulting from hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, droughts, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."
