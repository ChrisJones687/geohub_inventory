Environmental Compliance Tool,NA,private,FPAC,owned,"NOTE: This product just recently received funding and is expected to begin development by the beginning of 2024. 

For every Farm Service Agency (FSA) project, staff must conduct an environmental review and determine the need for a site-specific FSA-850. Preparing a site-specific FSA-850 can involve navigating a lengthy process that includes visiting greater than 10 different external websites to collect geospatial information for activities that require the use of a supported categorical exclusion. The completion of an FSA-850 for an activity with a greater potential for impacts to legally protected resources requires a “supported categorical exclusion” that currently takes between 60 to 180 minutes to complete the paper process, while activities utilizing a listed categorical exclusion take approx. 15 minutes to complete. 

The development of a digitized and automated environmental compliance tool will greatly speed completion of FSA-850s. Further, it would facilitate consistent field staff decision-making and ensure compliance with law/policy, shielding the agency and producers from litigation. ENV is developing an web-based tool to streamline the required environmental compliance for FSA projects, by automating the current paper form, the FSA-850, and streamlining the geospatial analysis required by utilizing web services to bring all the external geospatial information into a single tool. 

This tool would have four main components: 
•	Geospatial visualization of regulatory data sources, 
•	Screening for any available and applicable Programmatic FSA-850s,
•	Digitized version of the FSA-850 form, and 
•	Reportable database.
